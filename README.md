## About Six-Card Stud Poker Hand Analyzer:
Poker Hand Analyzer is program that is simulates, analyzes and evaluates five card poker hands derived from a six-card hand. This is a variant that adopts somewhere between stud poker and draw poker.
This version will not allow ties and pot splitting. It will evaluate each tiebreaker and will always have one unique winner.
It follows an object-oriented design and has a clean evaluation logic and how to determine each tie-breaker "by ranks and suit". The prokect contains arrays, collections, enums, custom classes, and file I/O. all organized with a clean object oriented design.
